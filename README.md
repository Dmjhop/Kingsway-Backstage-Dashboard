## Highlights
<p>Each week, my church production leads had to print out individual documents with all of the information needed for our worship team to know what mics and in-ear monitor packs to use. I figured why not utilize a tool we already adopted, Planning Center, check out their API, and make a dynamic dashboard.

So that's what I did! Using a combination of <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.JS</a>, <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a>, <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">ShadCN's</a> awesome component library, a dynamic and regularly updated dashboard was created! 

As mentioned, I am using Planning Center's <a href="https://www.planningcenter.com/developers">API</a> to fetch for all of the data points displayed that's regularly reloaded every 10 seconds. It will also not advance to the next week's plan until each Sunday has finished up! 

Version 1 of this Dashboard is complete but I soon want to create a Version 2 that has more features in it!</p>
