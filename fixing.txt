services.v2.events.plan.live.updated


This API call works for grabbing all positions for a particular plan and what roles the person is scheduled to do that sunday
https://api.planningcenteronline.com/services/v2/service_types/1536328/plans/75144412/team_members


One of the attributes is NOTES which is a string

So when an APi call is made, once the data comes back if the notes say v1,v2,v3,v4,v5 that will associate the state of the dashboard and pull the first name/last initial(both through JS string manipulation)/photo_thumbnail attribute and display that beside the name

Notes will go as followed (Notes only need to be used for the band)
v1 = Vox 1
v2 = Vox 2
v3 = Vox 3
v4 = Vox 4
v5 = Vox 5
v6 = Vox 6

iem1 = IEM 1
iem2 = IEM 2
iem3 = IEM 3
iem4 = IEM 4
iem5 = IEM 5
iem6 = IEM 6
wired = wired

switchmd = Switch MD
wiredMD = Wired MD

inst1 = Instrument Pack 1

Production Team roles will be associated with the attribute team_position_name

https://api.planningcenteronline.com/services/v2/service_types/1536328/plans/75144412/team_members?include=team&where[team_id]=6206998

Next Questions:

2. How do I make a stage map that makes sense? (look up drag and drop js frameworks)

3. How will I be able to find the the servicetype correct id and the team id?
    ANSWER: The API explorer will provide the particular service type and team id when I gain developer access to PCO
